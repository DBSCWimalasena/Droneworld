                <h2>Holy Stone HS440 Camera</h2>
                <p>The drone comes with a decent HD camera, there is no micro SD card slot, so you will have to record your video and photos over WIFI, which isn’t ideal, but the quality is alright as long as you fly in good weather.</p>
                <p>The camera can be remotely tilted 90° downwards to get better viewing angles and the live video feed is alright is good for a cheap drone.</p>
                <p>Cheap drones with cameras are very popular and the HS440 is a good choice, however, there are better options at similar price points, my personal favourite is the DJI Tello drone.</p>
